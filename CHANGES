Changelog
=========


0.2.2 (?)
---------------------

* Simpler implementation of the ``bind`` function. Should be faster too!
* The ``bind`` function can now be used on functions with varargs
* The ``bind`` function can now be used as a decorator
* The ``bind`` function doesn't allow the override of injected parameters
  anymore: it was a bad idea!
* The ``provide`` method/function can now be used as a decorator
* Removed the ``late_binding`` feature since it was not necessary: if you want
  to bind an argument with a function object but don't want it to be called
  during the binding, put it inside a lambda.
* Removed logging to reduce clutter: the user can log whatever he wants by
  subclassing our classes
* PEP8 conformance
